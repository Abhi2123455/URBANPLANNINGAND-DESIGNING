# URBANPLANNINGAND-DESIGNING
.

ðŸ“Œ Introduction


Urban planning and designing involves organizing and optimizing land use in urban areas to ensure livable, efficient, and environmentally responsible cities. This project leverages spatial data, public datasets, and visualization tools to support better decision-making in city development.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives


Analyze spatial and demographic data for optimized urban layouts.

Identify zones for residential, commercial, and industrial use.

Improve public transportation and infrastructure networks.

Integrate green spaces and enhance environmental sustainability.

Use data-driven models and simulations for future urban growth.

ðŸ“Š Data Sources

OpenStreetMap (OSM): Road and infrastructure data

Government Census: Population and demographic statistics

Satellite Imagery (Landsat/Sentinel): Land use classification

Urban GIS Layers: From municipal or national data portals

Real-time Data (Optional): Traffic and environmental sensors

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Languages: Python, JavaScript

Libraries:


geopandas, shapely, folium â€“ for spatial data

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly â€“ for visualization

scikit-learn, TensorFlow â€“ for modeling and predictions

GIS Tools: QGIS, ArcGIS
